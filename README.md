# teraDuraMacroChangelog
Its just the changelog of the macro i'm doing
## 06/10/2024
> * The macro is recognizing Roblox (app) and Roblox (from microsoft store) as different roblox(es) so its the start to make it work
> * I'm having an issue with the size of the windows, even though it is programmed to be the same, there are some notable differences on height and width (for further fixes, i'll call it bug01)
> * Added a msgBox to guide the user on the start and some button inputs so the user can fix the macro if he messes up, without the need to reopen it
