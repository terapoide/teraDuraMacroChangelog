# teraDuraMacroChangelog
Its just the changelog of the macro i'm doing
## 06/10/2024
> * The macro is recognizing Roblox (app) and Roblox (from microsoft store) as different roblox(es) so its the start to make it work
> * I'm having an issue with the size of the windows, even though it is programmed to be the same, there are some notable differences on height and width (for further fixes, i'll call it bug01)
> * Added a msgBox to guide the user on the start and some button inputs so the user can fix the macro if he messes up, without the need to reopen it
> * Added a Menu where there is a majin logo (temporary, i made on paint), and options for the user ~~(todo01: add Sliders and labels to make it prettier)~~
> * Added some information for scripters that may work with me in the same project using ";"
> * ~~Todo1: Started working on the Sliders thing and i am currently struggling to use its value on other variable (i had never used sliders before)~~
> * I finnaly understood how Sliders work and how to get the value, it took me 2 hours but i can continue with the Project
> * Finished GUI
> * ~~Todo2: Make a Stamina and Health verification based on the slider, and the define where are the marks on the HP bar~~
> * i did the part where it saves the button position and started making the attacking part
