# teraDuraMacroChangelog
Its just the changelog of the macro i'm doing

> * The macro is recognizing Roblox (app) and Roblox (from microsoft store) as different roblox(es) so its the start to make it work
> * I'm having an issue with the size of the windows, even though it is programmed to be the same, there are some notable differences on height and width
